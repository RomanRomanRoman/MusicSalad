  1)composition:
  ideas:
    - use dynamically changing composition to keep user in tension->trying to find some patterns;
    - make user to feel like if (he knows the composition & hears it for the first time)
  #Plan
    ¬ begin with a certain tune
    ¬ play it for a while
    ¬change melody part by part
    ¬do not stop changing rhytm,key,,everything until...
    ¬start implementing our tune(used in the beginning of the track) part by part,in different order ,
      using different key,rhytm,etc.
    ¬Make listener to feel as had heard last part of melody & make this part so signifficantly different
      to make user to understand connection with the first part only(mostly) on subconscious level.
    
   possible implementation clues:
   ^ change tune/key/rhytm(add shuffle);
   ^ break tune into several parts and then shuffle;
   ^ each part can be played in different key;
   
  possible perfect results:
       +user hears recognisable tune at the end but he can not remember where he heard it;
       +user realises that his brain takes 2 mostly different tunes and throws them in 1 to reduse data usage
       and realises that so many things can be treated as similar;
